# The Swimming Club2

## Project purpose and target audience

The Swimming Club website was created to address a simple but important problem: people who want to join a friendly, active community often need an easy way to understand what the club offers, when sessions take place, and how to get involved. The site gives new and returning users a central place to discover the club, view its activities, and sign up without needing to contact a club member directly.

The target audience includes:

- beginners who want a welcoming environment to start swimming
- active adults looking for regular fitness and social opportunities
- families and recreational swimmers interested in group sessions
- people living in or near Hull and Doncaster who want local club information

The value of the website is that it makes the club feel approachable, organised and transparent. It helps users quickly understand the benefits of swimming, browse visual content, and take action by joining the club.

## User stories

The features of the site were designed around user needs. The following user stories explain the reasoning behind the structure and functionality:

- As a user, I want to understand the benefits of swimming so that I can see why joining the club is worthwhile.
  - This is addressed by the home page's reason section, which explains health, strength and social benefits.

- As a user, I want to see when the club meets so that I can plan my attendance.
  - This is addressed by the schedule information and meetup section on the home page.

- As a user, I want to view club activities visually so that I can get a sense of the atmosphere and membership experience.
  - This is addressed by the gallery page, which showcases images of swimmers and club sessions.

- As a user, I want to sign up easily so that I can join the club quickly.
  - This is addressed by the sign-up form, which collects key member details and validates important fields.

- As a user, I want to navigate the site on mobile devices so that I can access information while on the go.
  - This is addressed by the responsive layout and mobile navigation menu.

## UX design

### Wireframes

The project was planned around a simple three-page structure using a consistent brand identity and clear hierarchy. A rough wireframe concept is shown below.

```text
HOME PAGE
--------------------------------------------------
| Logo | Home | Gallery | Sign Up               |
--------------------------------------------------
| Hero image + club title / location             |
| Why swim with us?                              |
| Benefit cards                                   |
| Meetup schedule                                 |
| Footer with links + map + social icons          |
--------------------------------------------------

GALLERY PAGE
--------------------------------------------------
| Logo | Home | Gallery | Sign Up               |
--------------------------------------------------
| Page title                                     |
| Masonry-style grid of swimming photos           |
| Footer with links + map + socials               |
--------------------------------------------------

SIGN-UP PAGE
--------------------------------------------------
| Logo | Home | Gallery | Sign Up               |
--------------------------------------------------
| Form with name, email and swimming preference  |
| Submit button                                  |
| Footer with links + map + socials               |
--------------------------------------------------
```

### Colour choices

The site uses a calm, sporty palette that reflects water and fitness:

- white for the main background and clean navigation
- dark charcoal for text and contrast
- soft red/coral accent colour for emphasis and hero overlay
- dark green/olive for action buttons and call-to-action styling

These colours were chosen to feel active, approachable, and visually clean while still maintaining contrast for readability.

### Typography

The design uses:

- Oswald for headings to create a bold, energetic sports aesthetic
- Lato for body text to maintain readability and modern clarity

This pairing helps the site feel professional and sporty without becoming too heavy or difficult to read.

### Layout decisions

The layout is intentionally simple and user-focused:

- a fixed header with clear navigation
- a large hero section to establish identity immediately
- benefit cards for quick scanning of the value proposition
- gallery content placed in a responsive grid for visual storytelling
- sign-up form centralised for strong conversion focus

### Accessibility considerations

Accessibility was considered throughout the project:

- semantic HTML structure using headings, sections and landmarks
- visible focus states and clear navigation labels
- high contrast between text and background in most areas
- descriptive alt text on major images
- form labels are associated with inputs
- responsive layout improves usability across screen sizes

### Reasoning behind the design choices

The design aims to feel welcoming and active rather than corporate. The combination of strong imagery, bold headers, a clean layout and calm supporting colours helps communicate trust and community without overwhelming users.

## Features

### Existing features

- Responsive navigation menu for mobile and desktop users
- Hero banner with strong branding and club identity
- Benefits section explaining physical and mental health value
- Weekly session and meetup summary
- Gallery page with swimming-related imagery
- Sign-up form with required field validation
- Footer with social links, site navigation and embedded map
- JavaScript for mobile menu state and form validation

### How the features work

- The navigation menu collapses into a mobile-friendly toggle on smaller screens
- The hero section uses a background image and overlay to make the club branding stand out
- The gallery is displayed using CSS column layout for a modern, responsive image grid
- The sign-up form checks required fields before submission and prevents empty form data being sent
- The footer includes contact-friendly information, navigation and social icons for additional engagement

### Features for future implementation

Possible future enhancements include:

- a real booking or membership database
- a contact form connected to email or a CMS
- online event calendar with registration links
- user login and member dashboard
- additional filters or categories in the gallery
- animation enhancements for improved interaction

## Manual testing

Manual testing was completed locally by previewing the site in a browser and checking that core functionality worked as expected.

| Test area | Test performed | Expected result | Actual result | Pass/Fail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Navigation | Clicked Home, Gallery and Sign Up links | Each page loads correctly | Links worked as expected | Pass |
| Internal links | Verified links between pages | No broken internal navigation | Internal pages connected correctly | Pass |
| External links | Checked social media and map links | Links open correctly in a new tab or relevant destination | Social links were present and configured as external links | Pass |
| Sign-up form | Submitted empty form | Validation alert should appear | Required-field validation triggered as intended | Pass |
| Form fields | Entered valid information | Form should accept values and submit | Field inputs behaved correctly in the static demo form | Pass |
| Buttons | Checked join button and nav actions | Buttons respond and maintain visual styling | Buttons rendered and functioned appropriately | Pass |
| Responsiveness | Resized browser to mobile and tablet widths | Layout changes without overlap or clipping | Layout adjusted responsively | Pass |
| Content layout | Reviewed each section on the page | Sections remain readable and aligned | Layout matched the intended structure | Pass |

## Responsiveness testing

The website was reviewed across a range of screen sizes to make sure the layout remained usable on different devices.

### Device and browser review

- Mobile width: tested using a narrow browser window and responsive layout adjustments
- Tablet width: checked spacing, image sizing and readability
- Desktop width: verified full content alignment and navigation layout
- Browser review: Chrome/Chromium-based browser and browser developer tools were used for responsiveness testing

### Observations

- The navigation collapses cleanly on smaller screens
- Content stacks sensibly on narrow screens
- Images scale and maintain aspect ratio
- Forms remain readable and usable at smaller sizes
- The footer content reorganises to maintain readability

## HTML validation

Official W3C HTML validation was not executed in this environment. The recommended validation step is to submit each page to the W3C validator:

- https://validator.w3.org/

Evidence status:

- HTML validation has not been formally recorded in this local environment
- The site was manually checked for structure, semantic tags and page load correctness
- Final validation should be run before public deployment to confirm zero HTML errors

## CSS validation

Official W3C Jigsaw CSS validation was not executed in this environment. The recommended validation step is:

- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

Evidence status:

- CSS was reviewed for consistency and browser compatibility
- No browser console errors were noted during local preview testing
- Formal W3C validation should be run before final production release

## Accessibility testing

Accessibility checks were considered as part of the design and implementation process.

### Checklist

- keyboard navigation tested through links and form controls
- labels are present for form inputs
- colour contrast reviewed for readability between text and background
- alt text included for the main imagery
- semantic headings used to structure page content
- responsive design helps users with different device sizes and assistive needs

### Notes

The website is generally accessible for a static front-end project, but additional enhancements could improve accessibility further, such as stronger focus styling, more detailed ARIA labelling, and testing with screen readers.

## Bugs and fixes

### Issues encountered

1. Mobile navigation needed to close after a user selected a page.
   - Fix: JavaScript was used to remove the active state and collapse the nav toggle after a navigation click.

2. Empty form submission risk existed on the sign-up page.
   - Fix: JavaScript validation was added to check required fields before submission.

3. Responsive design had to be carefully managed for narrower screens.
   - Fix: media queries were used to adjust layout, spacing and image sizing.

### Remaining issues

- This is a static front-end project, so no server-side form processing is implemented
- The live social media links are placeholders and may be updated when official club profiles exist
- Some validation requirements should be re-run using the W3C official tools before final deployment

## Credits and attribution

This project uses the following resources and inspiration:

- Unsplash images used throughout the project for hero and gallery content
- Google Fonts used for typography
- Font Awesome icons used for social icons and decorative UI elements
- OpenStreetMap embedded map used in the footer
- Basic static website structure and styling approach based on front-end web development learning principles

All external resources were used for educational and project purposes. Where possible, project-specific branding should be updated later with the official club name, content and media assets.

## Reflection and evaluation

### What went well

- The website has a clear structure and simple navigation
- The design is visually consistent across each page
- The project effectively communicates the club's purpose and emotional appeal
- The responsive styling works well across different screen sizes

### What was challenging

- Balancing a design that looked modern while still being easy to read and navigate
- Ensuring the layout remained responsive without breaking the grid or image proportions
- Implementing validation in a lightweight way for a static site

### What changed from the original plan

The project remained close to its original concept, but the final implementation focused more strongly on mobile responsiveness and user experience clarity. The sign-up form and navigation behaviour were refined to better serve real users.

### What I learned

- how to structure a multi-page static website with consistent branding
- how to build responsive layouts using CSS media queries
- how to validate user input with JavaScript
- how to improve accessibility and readability through thoughtful design choices

### What I would improve with more time

- add a real backend and database for sign-ups
- create a richer event and booking system
- improve accessibility testing with more assistive technology review
- perform full W3C HTML and CSS validation before release
- add more detailed animations and enhanced content sections
